The dataset includes 351 images.
Face are annotated in folder format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 160x160 (Fit (black edges))
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -4째 to +4째 horizontally and -4째 to +4째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
